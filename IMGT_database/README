All of these are (unfortunately) copied and pasted from IMGT's website in AA form.

Note, the CDR3 loop is somewhere in between the V and J loci, so we'll have to include
both of these sequences for the determination of these loops... i.e. IGHV and IGHJ for
determining the heavy chain CDR3 loops

Note, I also had to remove certain parts of the "J gene" file, because Marta Borowska said this is also included in the CDR loops...
Was a somewhat arbitrary cutoff, but we cut where things looked conserved right before the G_G motif.

This is important because I will be picking out my CDR loops based on where there are gaps in sequence similarity with conserved regions...
